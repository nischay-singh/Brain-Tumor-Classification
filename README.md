# Brain Tumor Classification
This app uses a machine learning model using convolutional neural networks that I created using a dataset of MRI scans(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset). The model has an accuracy of 96.6% and can classify an image as either having a meningioma, glioma or a pituitary tumor, or no tumor. I then used Flask to create a simple app to use the model.
